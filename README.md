# hackpad
My own take on the hackpad using QMK as firmware

# Features
* 9 keys
* an EC11 encoder controlling volume (mutes upon press)
* a 128x32 oled display showing the currently playing music
* 16 neopixel leds for backlighting efects
* case consisting of two parts
* some nice drawings by my girlfriend on the silkscreen and on the case
* QMK (maybe I'll add VIA sometime)

the keyboard fits together using 7 M3 screws - 3 for the pcb and 4 for the case itself which comes in two parts.
